Form Validation with React and Formik
This project is a simple React form that demonstrates form validation using Formik and Yup. The form includes fields for Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password. The Email field checks for a valid email format, the Password field ensures the user enters the correct predefined password, and the Confirm Password field verifies that the password matches the value entered in the Password field.

Features
Formik for form handling and validation.
Yup for defining validation schemas.
Validation for required fields (Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password).
Custom error messages for invalid input.
Confirm Password validation to ensure both passwords match.
A responsive layout using basic CSS.
